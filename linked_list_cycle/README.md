# **Linked list cycle**

## **General**

This task in the Interview_Prepar"hathon" is about writing a C program (C my Love :heart:) <br>
for detecting a cycle in a singly linked list.
WHy the Hell would we need that in the real-world ? According to few research on an openAI chat, this may be useful and important
for the following reasons:
- **Resource allocation** In a system where resources are allocated to different processes, it may be important to ensure that there are no cycles in the dependancy graph of resources (think we're gonna see the graphs later in Low Level Algorithms Specialization, keep an eye on my HolbertonSchool-system_linux repo!) A cycle in the dependency graph coul lead to deadlock or other resource allocation issue
- **Garbage collection** In programming languages with automatic memory management(Python, Java for example), detecting cycles in data structures is an important part of garbage collection. If cycle exists ==> some more memory cannot be freed since it's still referenced by the cycle.
- **Network Routing** Detecting cycles in routing tables or network topologies can be important for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission.
- **Compiler Optimization** In optimizing compilers purpose, detecting cycles in control flow graphs (which represents the control flow of a program) can help identify loops that can be optimized for a better execution


## **Conclusion**
That's a Useful Exercice to study on !!!
**Thanks**
