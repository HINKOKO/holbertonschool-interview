# **Palindrom Integer**

## **Requirement**

Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome. <br>

==> While palindrome checks may not be required in every computer engineering task, they serve as a valuable
exercise for programming practice, logical reasoning, and algorithms development.
The concept of palindroms provides a useful playground for understanding algorithms and data manipulation techniques.

Palindrom checks often appears as challenges in programming competitions, coding interviews, and algorithmics problem-solving
scenarios.
Besides that, palindrome may be used in:
- **Cryptography** they can play a role in cryptography and data security. <br> 
	Some encryption and decryption may involve palindromic properties or use palindromes as part of their operations.
- **Data validation** Palindrome checks can be used in data validation scenarios.
- **String manipulation**
