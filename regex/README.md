# **Regex the lost dinosaurus**

- **str** can be empty, and can contain any ASCII character in the exception of `.` and `*`
- **pattern** can be empty, and can contain any ASCII character, **including** `.` and `*`
- The regular expression matching must support the characters `.` and `*` with:
  - `.` matches any single character
  - `*` matches zero or more of the preceding character

**Good luck \o/**
