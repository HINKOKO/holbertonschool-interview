# **Pascal's triangle**

## **Overview**

**Blaise Pascal** French mathematician (1623-1662) despite his relatively brief time on Earth, he made a significant contributions to mathematics, physics and philosophy with "The thoughts of Blaise Pascal" (Ask Nathan Lapeyre #C14 He really knows about this stuff !)

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that provides a wide range of applications, in various fields going from mathematics, combinatorics, probability theory, calculus, and more... Pascal is so hot ! <br>
This Python script allows you to generate and print Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows <br>

## **USe cases**

- **Having fun** in Holberton-School-Interview path (Thank you Pascal)
- **COmbinatorics, Probability & Statistics** Pascal's triangle provides coefficients for binomial expansions, (essentials in probability theory), helps in calculating the number of ways to choose items from a larger set
- **Number theory** Can be used in proving some theorems
- **Geometry** Study of triangle and tetrahedra
- **Coding theory** In coding theory, used to construct **error-correcting codes** <br>
  What the heck ? Error-correcting codes are a type of code that includes extra information (redundancy) in such a way that errors received in the message can be detected and fixed. Imagine sending message over a noisy channel, there's a chance some bits gets flipped or corrupted. <br>
  "Hamming code" is a basic correcting-code technic inspired by the Pascal's triangle 'redundancy' pattern. <br>
